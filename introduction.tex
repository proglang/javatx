\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Java is one of the most important programming languages. In 2019, Java
was the second most popular language according to a study
based on GitHub
data.\footnote{\url{https://www.businessinsider.de/international/the-10-most-popular-programming-languages-according-to-github-2018-10/}} Estimates
for the number of Java programmers range between 7.6 and 9 million.\footnote{\url{https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-languages-python-developers-now-outnumber-java-ones/},
\url{http://infomory.com/numbers/number-of-java-developers/}} Java
has been around since 1995 and progressed through 16 versions.

Swarms of programmers have taken their first steps in Java. Many more
have been introduced to object-oriented programming through Java, as
it is among the first mainsteam languages supporting
object-orientation. Java is a class-based language with static single inheritance among
classes, hence it has nominal types with a specified subtyping
hierarchy. Besides classes there are interfaces to characterize common 
traits independent of the inheritance hierarchy. Since version J2SE~5.0,
the Java language supports F-bounded polymorphism in the form of generics.

Java is generally explicitly typed with some amendments introduced in
recent versions. That is, 
variables, fields, method parameters, and method returns must be
adorned with their type. An adaptation of a generic example from Featherweight Java
\cite{DBLP:journals/toplas/IgarashiPW01} 
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:intro-example-generic-fj}.

While the overhead of explicit types look reasonable in the example,
realistic programs often contain variable initializations like
the following:\footnote{Taken from
  \url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4120216/map-of-maps-how-to-keep-the-inner-maps-as-maps/4120268}.} 
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\fontsize{8}{9.6}\selectfont,style=fgj]
  HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Object>> outerMap =
    new HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Object>>();
\end{lstlisting}

Java's \emph{local variable type inference} (since version 10\footnote{\url{https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286}}) deals
satisfactorily with examples like the initialization of
\lstinline{outerMap}. 
In many initialization scenarios for local variables, Java infers their type
if it is obvious from the context. In the
example, we can write
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\fontsize{8}{9.6}\selectfont,style=fgj]
var outerMap = new HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Object>>();
\end{lstlisting}
because the constructor of the map spells out the type in
full. More specifically,``obvious'' means that the right side of the initialization is
\begin{itemize}
\item a constant of known type (e.g., a string),
\item a constructor call, or
\item a method call (the return type is known from the method
  signature).
\end{itemize}
The \lstinline{var} declaration can also be used for an iteration
variable where the type can be obtained from the elements of the
container or from the initializer.
Alternatively, if the variable is used as the method's return value,
its type can be obtained from the current method's signature.

However, there are still many places where the programmer must provide types. In
particular, an explicit type must be given for
\begin{itemize}
\item a field of a class,
\item a local variable without initializer or initialized to \lstinline{NULL},
\item a method parameter, or
\item a method return type.
\end{itemize}

In this paper, we study \emph{global type inference} for Java. Our aim
is to write code that omits most type annotations, except for class
headers and field types. Returning to the \lstinline{Pair} example, it
is sufficient to write the code in Figure~\ref{fig:intro-example-generic-jtx}
and global type inference fills in the rest so that the result is
equivalent to Figure~\ref{fig:intro-example-generic-fj}. Our
motivation to study global type inference is threefold.
\begin{itemize}
\item Programmers are relieved from writing down obvious types. 
\item Programmers may write types that leak implementation details. The
  \lstinline{outerMap} example provides a good example of this
  problem. From a software engineering
  perspective, it would be better to use a more general abstract type like
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\fontsize{8}{9.6}\selectfont,style=fgj]
Map<String, Map<String, Object>> outerMap = ...
\end{lstlisting}
  Global type inference finds most general types.
\item Programmers may write types that are more specific than
  necessary instead of using generic types. Here, type
  inference helps programmers to find the most general type. Suppose
  we wanted to add a static  method \texttt{eqPair} for pairs of integers to the
  \lstinline/Pair/ class.
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\fontsize{8}{9.6}\selectfont,style=fgj]
boolean eqPair (Pair<Integer,Integer> p) {
  return p.fst.equals(p.snd);
}
\end{lstlisting}
  With global type inference it is sufficient to write the code on the
  left of Figure~\ref{fig:equal-pair} and obtain the FGJ code with the most general type on the right.
\end{itemize}
  \begin{figure}[t]
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.49\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=tfgj]
eqPair (p) {
  return p.fst.equals(p.snd);
}
\end{lstlisting}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.49\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=fgj]
<T> boolean eqPair (Pair<T,T> p){
  return p.fst.equals<T>(p.snd);
}
\end{lstlisting}
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{\lstinline{eqPair} in \TFGJ and FGJ}
    \label{fig:equal-pair}
  \end{figure}
% \item Sometimes, it can be hard to find a correct typing at all.

In this paper, we study global type inference for Featherweight
Generic Java \cite{DBLP:journals/toplas/IgarashiPW01} (FGJ), which is backed
by an implementation for full Java. Our type inference algorithm
applies to FGJ programs that specify the full class header and all field types,
but omit all method signatures. 
Given this input, our algorithm
infers a set of most general method signatures (parameter types and return types).
Inferred types are generic as much as possible, but do not include
bounds.

The inferred signatures have the following round-trip property
(relative completeness). If we
start with an FGJ program that does not make use of polymorphic
recursion (see Section~\ref{sec:polym-recurs}), strip all types from
method signatures, and run the algorithm on the 
resulting stripped program, then at least one of the inferred typings is more
general than the types in the original FGJ program.
