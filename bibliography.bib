abstract = {MLsub extends traditional Hindley-Milner type inference with subtyping while preserving compact principal types, an exciting new development. However, its specification in terms of biunification is difficult to understand, relying on the new concepts of bisubstitution and polar types, and making use of advanced notions from abstract algebra. In this paper, we show that these are in fact not essential to understanding the mechanisms at play in MLsub. We propose an alternative algorithm called Simple-sub, which can be implemented efficiently in under 500 lines of code (including parsing, simplification, and pretty-printing), looks more familiar, and is easier to understand.  We present an experimental evaluation of Simple-sub against MLsub on a million randomly-generated well-scoped expressions, showing that the two systems agree. The mutable automaton-based implementation of MLsub is quite far from its algebraic specification, leaving a lot of space for errors; in fact, our evaluation uncovered several bugs in it. We sketch more straightforward soundness and completeness arguments for Simple-sub, based on a syntactic specification of the type system.  This paper is meant to be light in formalism, rich in insights, and easy to consume for prospective designers of new type systems and programming languages. In particular, no abstract algebra is inflicted on readers.},

                  wildcards, which is one of the new features of
                  the Java programming language in version
                  JDK5.0. Wildcards help alleviating the
                  impedance mismatch between generics, or
                  parametric polymorphism, and traditional
                  object-oriented subtype polymorphism. They do
                  this by quantifying over parameterized types
                  with different type arguments. Wildcards take
                  inspiration from several sources including
                  use-site variance, and they could be considered
                  as a way to introduce a syntactically
                  light-weight kind of existential types into a
                  main-stream language. This formalization
                  describes the mechanism, in particular the
                  wildcard capture process where the existential
                  nature of wildcards becomes evident.",
