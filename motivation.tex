\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

% Examples, examples, examples from simple to more advanced showing off
% the (difficult) features of inference.

In this section, we present a sequence of more and more challenging
examples for global type inference (GTI). To spice up our examples
somewhat, we assume some predefined utility classes with the following
interfaces.
\begin{lstlisting}
class Bool {
  Bool not(); 
}
class Int {
  Int negate ();
  Int add (Int that);
  Int mult (Int that);
}
class Double {
  Double negate ();
  Double add (Double that);
  Double multi (Double that);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Multiplication}
\label{sec:multiplication}

Here is the TFGJ code  for multiplying the components of a pair.
\begin{lstlisting}
class MultPair {
  mult (p) { return p.fst.mult(p.snd); }
}
\end{lstlisting}
Assuming the parameter typing $\mv p:\mv P$, result type $\mv R$, and that
\texttt{mult} in the body refers to \texttt{Int.mult}, we
obtain the following constraints.
\begin{itemize}
\item From \texttt{p.fst}: $\mv P \le \mathtt{Pair}\Angle{X,Y}$ and
  $\texttt{p.fst} : X$
\item From \texttt{p.snd}: $\mv P \le \mathtt{Pair}\Angle{X,Y}$ and
  $\texttt{p.snd} : Y$
\item From \texttt{.mult (p.snd)}: $X \le \mathtt{Int}$, $Y \le
  \mathtt{Int}$, and $\mathtt{Int} \le \mv R$.
\end{itemize}
As the return type only occurs positively in the constraints, we can
set it to $\mathtt{Int}$.
% \begin{lstlisting}
% class MultPair {
%   Int mult (Pair<Int,Int> p) { return p.fst.mult(p.snd); }
% }
% \end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
class MultPair {
  <X extends Int, Y extends Int>
  Int mult (Pair<X,Y> p) { return p.fst.mult(p.snd); }
}
\end{lstlisting}
We obtain a second version if we assume that \texttt{mult} refers to
\texttt{Double.mult}.
\begin{lstlisting}
class MultPair {
  <X extends Double, Y extends Double>
  Double mult (Pair<X,Y> p) { return p.fst.mult(p.snd); }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, \texttt{mult} might be recursive, which results different constraints.
\begin{itemize}
\item From \texttt{.mult (p.snd)}: $X \le \mathtt{MultPair}$, $Y \le
  \mathtt{P}$, and $\mathtt{R} \le \mv R$.
\end{itemize}
Combining $\mv P \le \mathtt{Pair}\Angle{X,Y}$ and $Y \le \mathtt{P}$
yields $Y \le \mathtt{Pair}\Angle{X,Y}$, which is not solvable and
hence rejected. 

The corresponding example in full Java would be the dot product. In
full Java, we also have to deal with overloading of the multiplication
operator, which amounts to considering \texttt{Int.mult} and
\texttt{Double.mult}. Overloading is not allowed in FGJ, but method
names in different classes may overlap.


\subsection{Inheritance}
\label{sec:inheritance}

\begin{figure}[tp]
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.49\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
class A1 {
  m(x) { return x.add(x); }
}
class B1 extends A1 {
  m(x) { return x; }
}
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.49\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
class A2 {
  m(x) { return x; }
}
class B2 extends A2 {
  m(x) { return x.add(x); }
}
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Method overriding}
  \label{fig:method-overriding}
\end{figure}

Let's start with the artificial example in the left
listing of Figure~\ref{fig:method-overriding} and ignore the \texttt{Double} class. Type
inference proceeds according 
to the inheritance hierarchy starting from the superclasses. Class \texttt{A1} has
a method \texttt{m} of inferred type \texttt{Int -> Int}. Class \texttt{B1} is a
subclass of \texttt{A1} which must override \texttt{m} as there is no
overloading in FGJ. However, the inferred
type of \texttt{B1.m()} is \texttt{<T> T -> T}, which is not a correct
method override for \texttt{A1.m()}.
Hence, we have to instantiate the type of \texttt{B1.m()} to
\texttt{Int -> Int}.

Conversely, for the right listing of Figure~\ref{fig:method-overriding}, GTI finds that
\texttt{A2.m} has the generic type \texttt{<T> T -> T} while \texttt{B2.m} has type
\texttt{Int -> Int}. Again, these types do not give rise to a correct method override and
GTI is forced to instantiate the type of \texttt{A2.m} to \texttt{Int -> Int}.

\todo[inline]{This example shows that GTI must first collect the constraints 
  for all methods \texttt{m{}} in a class hierarchy. Generalization can only happen after
  all constraints on \texttt{m}'s type have been considered.}

% Otherwise, we would get strange results. Consider extending the
% program with classes \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} by the following class.
% \begin{lstlisting}
% class C {
%   mbool(x) { return x.m(new Bool()); }
% }
% \end{lstlisting}
% Inferring the type of \texttt{C.mbool()} using \texttt{A.m()} would
% fail because \texttt{Int} and \texttt{Bool} are not
% unifiable. However, inferring the type of \texttt{C.mbool()} using
% \texttt{B.m()} (with the generic type) would succeed and yield the
% typing
% \begin{lstlisting}
% class C {
%   Bool mbool(B x) { return x.m(new Bool()); }
% }
% \end{lstlisting}


In full Java, type inference would have to offer two alternative
results: either two different
overloaded methods (one inherited and one local) in \texttt{B1}/\texttt{B2} or
impose the typing \texttt{Int B1.m(Int)} or \texttt{Int A2.m(Int)} to enforce correct overriding. 


\subsection{Inheritance and Generics}
\label{sec:inheritance-generics}


\begin{lstlisting}[float,caption={Function class}, label={lst:function-class}]
class Function<S,T> {
  T apply(S arg) { return this.apply (arg); }
}
\end{lstlisting}
Suppose we are given the generic FGJ class for modeling functions in Listing~\ref{lst:function-class}.
This code is constructed to serve as an ``abstract'' super class to derive more
interesting subclasses.
The class \texttt{Function<S,T>} must be presented in this explicit
way. Its type annotations \textbf{cannot} be inferred by GTI because
the use to the generic class parameters in the method type cannot be inferred from the
implementation.

If we applied GTI to the type-erased version of
Listing~\ref{lst:function-class}, the \texttt{apply} method would be considered a generic method: 
\begin{lstlisting}
  apply (arg) { ... }  --GTI-->    <A,B> B apply (A arg) { ... }
\end{lstlisting}
The typing of \texttt{apply} in Listing~\ref{lst:function-class} is an
instance of this result, so that completeness of GTI is preserved!

% While it is possible to  force GTI to infer the intended typing, it requires some awkward coding.
% \begin{lstlisting}
% class Function<S,T> {
%   S in;
%   T out;
%   dummy (arg) { return this.dummy(in); }
%   apply (arg) { return new Pair<>(this.out, this.dummy (arg)).fst; }
% }
% \end{lstlisting}

Now that we have the abstract class \texttt{Function<S,T>} at our
disposal, let us apply GTI to a class of boxed values with a
\texttt{map} function:
\begin{lstlisting}
class Box<S> {
  S val;
  map(f) {
    return new Box<>(f.apply(this.val));
} }
\end{lstlisting}
GTI finds the following constraints
\begin{itemize}
\item the return value must be of type \texttt{Box<T>}, for some type
  \texttt{T},
\item \texttt{T} is a supertype of the type returned by
  \texttt{f.apply},
\item \texttt{apply} is defined in class \texttt{Function<S1,T1>} with
  type \texttt{T1 apply(S1 arg)}, 
\item hence \texttt{T1 <: T} and \texttt{S <: S1} (because
  \texttt{this.val : S}),
\end{itemize}
and resolves them to the desired outcome where \texttt{T1=T} and
\texttt{S=S1} using the methods of
Simonet~\cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/Simonet03}. 
\begin{lstlisting}
class Box<S> {
  S val;
  <T> Box<T> map(Function<S,T> f) {
    return new Box<T>(f.apply<S,T>(this.val));
} }
\end{lstlisting}
But what happens if we add useful subclasses of \texttt{Function} as in
\begin{lstlisting}
class Not extends Function<Bool,Bool> {
  apply(b) { return b.not(); }
}
class Negate extends Function<Int,Int> {
  apply(x) { return x.negate(); }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\todo[inline]{Does this approach really make sense? If we have a
  subclass that overrides a method of the superclass, then the public
  interface should be the one of the superclass. Subsequently, the
  implementation of the method in the subclass should be checked
  against the type inferred for the superclass.}
If we rerun GTI with these classes, we now have additional
possibilities to invoke the \texttt{apply} method. With \texttt{Not}, we need to use the
generic type of \texttt{Function.apply()}, but instantiate it according to
\texttt{Function<Bool,Bool>}. Thus,
we obtain the constraints \texttt{Bool <: T} and \texttt{S <: Bool} for \texttt{T = Bool}
and \texttt{S = Bool}, which are both satisfiable. With
\texttt{Negate} we run into the same situation with the constraints
\texttt{Int <: Int} and \texttt{Int <: Int}.
% That means there is no way to
% \emph{directly} invoke \texttt{Not.apply} or \texttt{Negate.apply}
% from \texttt{Box.map}, but it may happen indirectly via inheritance.

Here is another subclass of \texttt{Function<S,T>} that we want
to consider.
\begin{lstlisting}
class Identity<S> extends Function<S,S> {
  S apply(S arg) { return arg; }
}
\end{lstlisting}
Here, we obtain the following type constraints
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{apply} is defined in class \texttt{Identity<S1>} with
  type \texttt{S1 apply (S1 arg)},
\item hence \texttt{S1 <: T} and \texttt{S <: S1}.
\end{itemize}
Resolving the constraints yields \texttt{S = T} thus the typing
\begin{lstlisting}
Box<S> map(Identity<S> f);
\end{lstlisting}
which is an instance of the previous typing.

\subsection{Multiple results}
\label{sec:multiple-results}
% Our global type inference algorithm is able to infer every type annotation.
% For the sake of simplicity we will only consider method types in this
% paper and assume that field types are specified.
\begin{figure}[tp]
  \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
class List<A> {
  List<A> add(A item) {...}
  A get() { ... }
}
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{minipage}
  ~$\left|
  \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
class Global{
  m(a){
    return a.add(this).get();
} }
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{minipage}\right.$
  \caption{Example for multiple inferred types}
  \label{fig:example-types-not-unique}
\end{figure}
Consider the classes \texttt{List<A>} and \texttt{Global} in Figure~\ref{fig:example-types-not-unique}.
Global type inference processes classes in order of
dependency. Class \texttt{Global} may depend on
class \texttt{List} because \texttt{List} defines methods \texttt{add} and
\texttt{get} which may be used in \texttt{Global}. The dependency is
not certain because, in general, there may be additional classes
providing methods \texttt{add} and \texttt{get}.

In the example, it is safe to assume that the types for the methods of class \texttt{List}
are already available, either because they are given (as in the code
fragment) or because they were inferred before considering class \texttt{Global}.

The method \texttt{m} in class \texttt{Global} first invokes
\texttt{add} on \texttt{a}, so the type of \texttt{a} as well as the
return type of \texttt{a.add(this)} must be
\texttt{List<T>}, for some \texttt{T}. As \texttt{this} has
type \texttt{Global}, it must be that \texttt{Global} is a
subtype of \texttt{T}. By the typing of \texttt{get()} we find that
the return type of method \texttt{m} is also \texttt{T}.

But now we are in a dilemma because FGJ only supports \emph{upper bounds} for
type variables,\footnote{Java has the same restriction. Lower bounds
  are only allowed for wildcards.} so that 
\texttt{Global <: T} is not a valid constraint in FGJ.
To stay compatible with this restriction, global type inference
expands the constraint by instantiating \texttt{T} with the (two) superclasses fulfilling
the constraint, \texttt{Global} and \texttt{Object}.  They give rise to two incomparable
types for 
\texttt{m}, \texttt{List<Global> -> Global} and
\texttt{List<Object> -> Object}. So there are two different FGJ
programs that are completions of the \texttt{Global} class.

GTI models these instances using the \emph{intersection type}
\texttt{List<Global> -> Global} \verb!&! \texttt{List<Object> -> Object}
for method \texttt{m} and the different FGJ-completions of class \texttt{Global} are
instances of the intersection type:
\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
class Global {
  Global m(List<Global> a) {
    return a.add(this).get();
}
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
class Global {
  Object m(List<Object> a) {
    return a.add(this).get();
}
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}
% \begin{lstlisting}
% class Global {
%   <Global <: T> T m( List<T> a ) {
%     return a.add(this).get();
% }
% \end{lstlisting}
Additional classes in the program may further restrict the number of
viable types. Suppose we define a class \texttt{UseGlobal} as
follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
class UseGlobal {
  main() {
    return new Global().m(new List<Object>());
} }
\end{lstlisting}
Due to the dependency on \texttt{Global.m()}, type inference considers this class after class
\texttt{Global}. As it uses \texttt{m} at type
\texttt{List<Object> -> Object}, global type inference narrows the
type of \texttt{m} to just this alternative.

\subsection{Polymorphic recursion}
\label{sec:polym-recurs}
\begin{figure}[tp]
  \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
class UsePair {
  <X,Y> Object prc(Pair<X,Y> p) {
    return this.prc<Y,X> (p.swap<X,Y>());
} }
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{minipage}
  ~$\left|
  \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
class UsePair {
  prc(p) {
    return this.prc (p.swap());

} }
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{minipage}\right.$
  \caption{Example for polymorphic recursion}
  \label{fig:examples-poly-rec}
\end{figure}
A program uses \emph{polymorphic recursion} if there is a generic method that is invoked
recursively at a more specific type than its definition.
As a toy example for polymorphic recursion consider the class \texttt{UsePair} in FGJ with a
generic method \texttt{prc} that invokes itself
recursively on a swapped version of its argument pair
(Figure~\ref{fig:examples-poly-rec}, left).
This method makes use of polymorphic recursion because the type of the
recursive call is different from the declared type of the method. More
precisely, the declared argument type is \texttt{Pair<X,Y>} whereas
the argument of the recursive call has type
\texttt{Pair<Y,X>}---an instance of the declared type.

For this particular example, global type inference succeeds on the
corresponding stripped program shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:examples-poly-rec}, right, but it yields a more restrictive
typing of \texttt{<X> Object prc (Pair<X,X> p)} for the method. 
A minor variation of the program with a non-variable instantiation makes type inference fail entirely:
\begin{lstlisting}
class UsePair2 {
  <X,Y> Object prc(Pair<X,Y> p) {
    return this.prc<Y,Pair<X,Y>> (new Pair (p.snd, p));
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}



Polymorphic recursion is known to make type inference intractable
\cite{DBLP:journals/toplas/Henglein93,DBLP:journals/toplas/KfouryTU93}
because it can be reduced to an undecidable semi-unification problem
\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/KfouryTU93}. However, \emph{type checking} with
polymorphic recursion is tractable and routinely used in languages like Haskell
and Java.

GTI does not infer method types with polymorphic recursion. Inference either fails or
returns a more restrictive type. Methods making use of this features need to supply
explicit typings.
