\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Examples, examples, examples from simple to more advanced showing off
the (difficult) features of inference.

Features:
\begin{itemize}
\item same named methods in several classes are ok
\item class header is complete in the form
  $\mathtt{class}\ C\langle\overline X <: \overline N\rangle <: N \{
  \overline T\ \overline f;\ K\ \overline M \}$
\item constructor fully typed (as it is determined by the types of the
  fields and the supertype)
\item method signatures may be omitted, i.e., 
  $M\ ::=\ m(\overline x) \{ \ \mathtt{return}\ e;\ \}$
\item polymorphic recursive methods must be annotated.
\end{itemize}
