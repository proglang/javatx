\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper presents a global type inference algorithm applicable to
Featherweight Generic Java (FGJ). To this end, we define a language
\FGJGT that characterizes FGJ programs amenable to type inference: its
methods carry no type annotations and it does not permit polymorphic recursion.
This language corresponds to a strict subset of FGJ.

The inference algorithm is constraint based and is able to infer
generalized method types with bounded generic types, as demonstrated
with the example in Figure~\ref{fig:intro-example-generic-fj}.

In future work, we plan to extend \FGJGT to a calculus with wildcards
inspired by Wild~FJ \cite{TEP05}. 
We also plan to extend the formal calculus with lambda expressions
(cf.\ \cite{BBDGV18}), but using true function types in place of
interface types.
