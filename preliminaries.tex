  \caption{Syntax of TFGJ}
  \label{fig:syntax-tfgj}
\end{figure}
The input of GTI is a
program in Typeless Featherweight Generic Java (TFGJ). Its syntax
(shown in Figure~\ref{fig:syntax-tfgj}) differs
from Featherweight Generic Java (FGJ) in that it is possible to omit
the type annotations for method parameters and return types.%, except the ones for casts and \texttt{new} calls.
Also we leave out the generic type variables of the \texttt{new}-statement.

%All type annotations in our TGFJ language can be omitted ($T = \epsilon$).
%The only exception are fields which must be given a concrete type.

Another difference to the syntax of FGJ is that we added the special variable \texttt{this} to the syntax.
FJ treats \texttt{this} as a normal variable
but our algorithm treats it as a special variable which always has a predetermined type;
the type of the class it is used in.

\subsection{Featherweight Java Typing Rules}
\input{fjtyperules}

\subsection{Principal Type}
Featherweight Generic Java has no unique principal typing.
We can show this easily with an example.
We try to find the principal type for the method \texttt{method1}.
\begin{lstlisting}
class Global{
  method1(a){
    a.add(this);
    return a.get();
  }
}
class List<A> {
  add(A item){...}
  A get() ...
}
\end{lstlisting}
In \texttt{method1} neither the return type nor the type for the parameter \texttt{a} are specified.
The return type of the method depends on the type of \texttt{a}.
If we set in the type \texttt{List<Object>} here, then \texttt{method1} would return \texttt{Object}.
The type \texttt{List<Global>} would also be correct.
Then the return type of the method can also be the type \texttt{Global}.

The principal type would either be an intersection type or the method \texttt{method1} has to be overloaded.
FGJ neither supports intersection types nor overloading.
Therefore we cannot set in the principal type and have to stick with one of the possible solutions,
for example\\
\texttt{List<Global> method1(List<Global> a)}.

It is possible for a class to have multiple principal type solutions.
This can lead to a type error when compiling multiple classes.
\begin{lstlisting}
  class Global{
    method1(a){
      a.add(this);
      return a.get();
    }
  }
  class Class2{
    Object test(){
      return new Global().method1(new List<Object>());
    }
  }
\end{lstlisting}
Our type inference algorithm is able to infer all of the principal type solutions, but only one of them can be set in.
If we set in \texttt{List<Global>} as the parameter type for the \texttt{method1},
then the class \texttt{Class2} would lead to a type error.
In this case the type inference algorithm has to try another type solution for \texttt{method1}
to render the program type correct.
